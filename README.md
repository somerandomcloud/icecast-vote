This repo mainly exists for the websites code, but the server is also included. Beware, the server code is mostly made for my setup, because I don't think anyone without technical knowledge will want to use this at any point. 

Some packages that are being used work a little funky, and need to be used on Node14. Why? No clue. Just works like that for some reason.
